                            <p class ="paragraph">I am passionate about the built environment, in particular, smart buildings, automation and big data. I am from Australia but for the last 2 years have been living Switzerland, I am learning German but very basic level so far. <br><br>
                            I start my career in the building industry as a Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic spending the first 7 years working on a mixture of retail and commercial buildings and data centres in both air conditioning and controls. This experience gave me the foundation to understand the holistic operation of buildings from the most practical level.<br><br>
                            I then joined BUENO as a systems engineer where I helped deliver and create building analytics and optimization. This included building relationships with the clients and contractors to delivery significant savings and improvement on site.
                            I then progressed into the role of Head of Integrations. This role included supporting an ever growing team to develop intelligent solutions in gathering data from live system’s within a building and reaching business KPI’s. During this period I developed an interest in company culture and the role it plays in creating a successful company.<br><br>
                            My role with Willow was Head of Asset Operations. I was responsible for driving value from building data. Willow is focused on transforming the built environment through an intelligent digital approach.<br><br>
                            My current role is with Siemens Global development of sales and enterprise account strategies to bridge from our traditional portfolio of building technology into digital offerings, such as digitally-enhanced services, data-driven services,predictive maintenance, SaaS and related IoT infrastructure. <br><br>
                            I love my job and lucky to have this as my passion and hobby, if I am not working I am playing around with my home server or technology in some way. </p>

My interest specifically in IT came as a result of this but also my work, I ended up installing, maintenance managing Automation Systems which are basically scaled down IT networks, with field controllers, a network and programming with a bit of electrical work.

                                <p class="paragraph">Data Visualization - COVID 19 and GDP <br>

                                    We are currently in a unique situation, we have a global pandemic that is only beginning. 
                                    
                                    This has been difficult for every country, we have seen successful cases of countries getting this under control and not so successful methods. Understanding what went well and what didn't work. The more data we have, the more information we can look at retrospectively allows decisions to be made based on evidence and data. 
                                    
                                    Taking the data from COVID19 and the GDP we can link the effectiveness of countries based on possible resources available to them, ideally you could link resources available vs cases. This doesn't answer all the questions to be answered but can be a starting point in learning from this difficult situation. <br>
                                    
                                    First steps:<br>

                                   Requirements:  Needs to be flexible, transparent and intuitive. This requires selecting the right tools and filter functions.  </p>
