                            <p class ="paragraph">I am passionate about the built environment, in particular, smart buildings, automation and big data. I am from Australia but for the last 2 years have been living Switzerland, I am learning German but very basic level so far. <br><br>
                            I start my career in the building industry as a Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Mechanic spending the first 7 years working on a mixture of retail and commercial buildings and data centres in both air conditioning and controls. This experience gave me the foundation to understand the holistic operation of buildings from the most practical level.<br><br>
                            I then joined BUENO as a systems engineer where I helped deliver and create building analytics and optimization. This included building relationships with the clients and contractors to delivery significant savings and improvement on site.
                            I then progressed into the role of Head of Integrations. This role included supporting an ever growing team to develop intelligent solutions in gathering data from live system’s within a building and reaching business KPI’s. During this period I developed an interest in company culture and the role it plays in creating a successful company.<br><br>
                            My role with Willow was Head of Asset Operations. I was responsible for driving value from building data. Willow is focused on transforming the built environment through an intelligent digital approach.<br><br>
                            My current role is with Siemens Global development of sales and enterprise account strategies to bridge from our traditional portfolio of building technology into digital offerings, such as digitally-enhanced services, data-driven services,predictive maintenance, SaaS and related IoT infrastructure. <br><br>
                            I love my job and lucky to have this as my passion and hobby, if I am not working I am playing around with my home server or technology in some way. </p>

                                • Put plenty of examples into your notes and answers.<br>
                                • Remember the “real” things that happened. Search for the reality and the applications of ideas.<br>
                                • Go back to the laboratory or your laboratory manual or your practical notes. Recall the experiments and field visits where you learned.<br>

                                What do the results of these tests mean for you?<br>
                                It is clear to me that I am not a traditional learning, I can be very creative but also doing standard book learning exercises is not my ideal method. I work well in teams and can be very inclusive and attentive to others needs.<br><br>
                    
                                How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?<br>
                                I really can work with most groups and can be a good leader or follower, I am good communicator and can bring people along the journey. <br><br>
                                How should you take this into account when forming a team?<br>
                                A group should form with different personalities and mixing the workload to fit each person. Being inclusive and understanding of skills and prefered tasks will be critical to success.<br><br>

                                <p class="paragraph">Objective Reporting – Data driven journalism<br><br>
                                    Overview<br><br>

                                        The current bias we see in news is driving a shift in the public discourse.. This has been difficult for every country, the amount of information available and access to said information is at an all time high. <br><br>

                                        The more data we have, the more information we can look at retrospectively allows decisions to be made on evidence and educate a wider audience. My goal is to create a digital news service, no names, no click bait, no ads and as close to unbiased reporting as possible. This would be achieved using modern data capture, wrangling and visualisations to allow the reader to see the numbers and facts. This doesn't answer all the questions to be answered but can be a starting point to build faith in facts.<br><br>

                                        I see this being something that would require large amounts of data processing and visulisation, professional writing and exceptional UX. <br><br>


                                        Motivation <br><br>

                                        The world has seen a drastic decline in trust of news over the last few years with one study showing “Gallup has documented an erosion of trust in the news media over time. Between 2003 and 2016, the percentage of Americans who said they have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in the media fell from 54% to 32% before recovering somewhat to 41% in 2017 “</a><a href="#section2">[2]</a>. This is slightly different in Australia with more trust against international averages but a study conducted by QUT shows “Australian news consumers are primarily seeking greater accountability and transparency around the news content that is delivered. In particular, perceptions of bias need to be openly addressed, and the line between fact and opinion more clearly demarcated. “ This is why I believe data is key to be able to bring trust back to the news cycle, not static images, or bias reporting interactive data sets and objective reporting.<br><br>

                                        Description <br><br>

                                        Clean Website – A minimalist website, clean and ease of use as the main priority. Low amount of stories, high quality content with no processing of personal information or ad tracking. <br>
                                        Extensive Data Sets and Processing – The main difference for this news site would be based on the data collected as part of the reporting process. <br>
                                        Self Serve Data Visualisations – Showing a static image or graph can be misleading, allowing people to dig into information even if its a limited flexibility allows those inclined to confirm what is being said and the data isn't being misrepresented. <br>
                                        Professional Writing – Key to any media in written from precise, professional and “good” writing is a must, written in a manner that avoids bias and states facts. <br>
                                        No “writers or names” - Bias can start by peoples preconceived perceptions this include, age, race, sex, political party..etc. While removing names and personalities from the process it creates a reader who can more open to the story and not going into the process with bias even if its unconscious bias. <br>
                                        No ads – Any direct ads could lead to pressure to report on items or more important not report on items. This can be shown by companies or individuals buying media companies, an example if the Murdoch Press and the bias shown towards certain political parties or even in the case of the recent bush fires shown by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/04/the-australian-murdoch-owned-newspaper-accused-of-downplaying-bushfires-in-favour-of-picnic-races">The Guardian </a></a><a href="#section3">[3]</a>. The other reason is allowing google ads or similar programs to run against a website can also create an environment that is not indusive to a unbiased media experience. <br><br>

                                        
                                        Tools and Technologies<br><br>

                                        Data Collection – There will be many methods of obtaining the required data to build the case for stories reported on, the best language for this would be with Python, the methods would also include:<br>
                                        Rest API<br>
                                        CSV <br>
                                        Web Scrapping<br><br> 

                                        Data Visualisation – Data collection is important but showing the data in a way that doesn't lean to a certain narrative and can be understood will be key for this project. After looking at all the available options Dash/Plotly is the most used Data Science/ML tool used today. Making all the data visually appealing but also modifiable to the readers will be a main feature for the site. <br><br>

                                        Web Design – A fully interactive and clean website an example would be https://theintercept.com/  A website with no ads but pure content. This would need an extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br><br>

                                        
                                        Skills Required <br><br>

                                        Hosting – Cloud hosting needs to be secure, reliable and private. https://www.1984hosting.com/ would be an example of this service offering. This would require dev-ops experience to be able to host the website but setup required resources, luckily these hosting sites are setup to do this with ease. <br><br>

                                        Data Science – A high level of data science is required, python is the most common and suited tool to be able to process the data required. The open source community has led to a resources shared and developed globally and growing every day. This will be the main tool to collect and clean the data during the ETL process. <br><br>

                                        UI/UX – Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript will all be part of the process. Bootstrap is the most common framework used but there is many options like Foundation, Bulma etc... All of these options have different pros and cons and would be critical to the overall look and feel of the end product. <br><br>

                                        
                                        Outcome<br><br>

                                        The goal would to create news outlet that would build faith with the audience and create an environment that teaches the reader to read the data and understand the issue. This isn't a perfect scenario but its step closer to fact based reporting. Using the digital solutions available to us today, reporting based on the data. I would hope this would be a source for people who want to understand the facts, the science the actual figures on reporting.
